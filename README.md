# <marla-mockus-portfolio>

## Description

For week 2's challenge we began working on a portfolio page. This page is very important because it's a place we can display our completed projects as we go through bootcamp. This is a great place to send potential employers to view the skills we've developed over the past 6 months. While completing this project a lot of my HTML and CSS skills were refined. I started to fully understand how HTML and CSS are connected, and in what ways the layout of HTML and styling in CSS impacts a webpage. I had a lot of fun playing with different colors and images within the webpage, as well as hover objects.
